# Introduction

The goal of this book is to teach you how to write an operating system. This operating system will not be fancy or graphical, and you will not be able to play Windows games on it. At most likely be able to only run Bash and some other command line programs, such as GCC or Vim.

# x86-64

x86-64, also known as amd64, is the architecture we are going to be building our operating system for. It will be a 64-bit operating system. If you don't have an x86-64 chip it may be hard for you to use this book.

# Requirements

- nasm - Our Assembler
- gcc - Our C Compiler
- gld - Our Linker *
- make - Used For Automating Out Build
- qemu - Used To Test Our OS
- Knowledge Of Intel Assembly - Use Google

\* Mac OS X users beware, this is not the linker installed through Xcode. As a Mac user myself, I highly recommend switching to Linux, even if through Vagrant or Virtuial Box.
